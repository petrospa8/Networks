TCP communications are...
Oriented to large data segments.
Unidirectional and simultaneous.
*Bidirectional and simultaneous.
Not connection oriented.

The ISN (Initial Sequence Number) is generated randomly because:
*It avoids having conflicts with segments of older connections having the same ISN (reincarnation).
The system avoids taking into account all ISN that were generated.
It results in a safer encoding.
If the segment is lost it is easier for the sender host to generate a new random number instead of looking for the ISN of the lost segment (reincarnation).

If in Selective Repeat ARQ protocol several ACK's arrive out of order the sender will...
Detect the error and relabel the segments to fit the current sequence.
*Store the segments which ACK arrived before time in the buffer until the missing acknowledgments arrive, it will resend the packet after a timeout.
Send immediately the data segments that correspond to the conflicting ACK's again.
Reestablish the conection with the receiver.

Which number can we use to know the maximum segment size that will be able to be sent in a TCP connection? 
The MTU.
The MSS.
*The minimum between MTU and MSS.
None of above.

When we are downloading something from the internet and the connection is interrupted and resumed again, why don't we keep the same download speed that we previously had?
Because our computer is checking that the data that it had already downloaded was not corrupted in the process.
Because of the Nagle Algotithm, that restarts the connection in an increasing speed in order to avoid a sudden occupation of the bandwidth of the connection.
Because the network cards that computers use nowadays aren't still able to rapidly reach high data-transfer speeds.
*Because of the Slow Start Algorithm, the speed at which packets are sent is the one at which ACK's are receive, which results in an exponential speed.
